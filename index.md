### Leagues
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836014761102934036/836014820355473418/teams_VS.png)
- Eight divisions with an incentive to be in the top division - Top 100, 500, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000, 32000, rest
- Will have a monthly "season", with resetting at the end of the month
- Points allocated to losing teams as well, so less active teams will fall behind
> I am of the impression that the points for season rewards may be more related to each team member's scores rather than win/lose  
> E.g. if everybody scores 40k and there are 50 players, the season team points will be increased by 50x40k=+2000k
> This way they can compare teams in different divisions for purposes of promotion/relegation 
> ...  but I could be wrong!
- Points added up over month to determine level of season rewards and potential promotion/relegation
> Important to start matches ASAP to ensure we play as many matches as possible
- Will only face teams in the same division and never face the same team more than once per month
- For champions division (top 100), up to 50 teams can be relegated at the end of the month
- Champions division rewards: 1mm-1.5mm coins, 200-400 gems depending on month-end position, plus potential bonus rewards (chest?)
- Can be demoted multiple divisions.  Cannot be promoted more than two divisions
> This system means that every player's score counts as it could impact not only season rewards but also potential promotion/relegation
> i.e. No more relaxing if it is a clear win/loss
> Strong incentive to ensure every member pulls their weight. I would not be suprised if this results in more aggressive mergers, recruitment and pruning of teams.
> I'm concerned that this could put pressure on the team culture, as strong players will be less happy about carrying weaker players.  I am very open to suggestions of how we can keep things harmonious given the increased incentives for mercenary action.
> Let's keep in mind that our team is about relaxing and having fun.  And that we should not jeopardize this for a few extra rewards!
> I expect us to be in the second best division - with perhaps occasional months in the top division?

## Advice
### Adventure Setups
Draft base on VMinchBosch data - **work-in-progress do not distribute!**  
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/806343355264401478/842843192398446622/image0.png)
### Track Tips

 Track | Tip 
 -- | --   
**The Carousel** (Bill's Circuit 2) | Do a backflip at high point in cave e.g. with rally  
**Flying Log** (Forest Cup 3) | Wait five seconds to reposition fuel  
**Forgotten Highway** | High roads are generally quicker if you can make them  
**Frostfire Caverns** | Go under the second mountain i.e.down into the cavern  
**Lonely Camper** (Boggy Road 3) | Generally smoother to go the low route at 320m to go (near the start)  
**Muddy Road** (Boggy Road 1) | Often quicker to break through the board at 200m to go, and go down  
0**Snappy Swamps** (Alligator Cup 2) | ⚠ alligators at 50m to go. Fly over and wheelie; or go under carefully if you fit  
**Tunnel Vision** (Tunnels 1) | Go down the tunnel at 280m to go. It is a shortcut  
**Watery Tunnel** (Cup of City Water 2) | Generally quicker to brake and go low route through the water  


### General HCR2 Advice
1. Be respectful and friendly to others
2. Finish the weekly public event
3. Finish the monthly 50k season
4. Open the free and video chests in the shop
5. Open the daily 10-win chest
6. Open six free 3h chests (resets every 12 hours)
7. Do all the adventure tasks (at least to level 1 chest)
8. Finish the 3 daily tasks 
9. Have a chest timing down
10. Scrap excess parts
11. Make sure the team km chest reaches at least level 18 for legendary parts 
12. Compete in every team event
13. Buy 10k common and 50k rare parts in the shop with coins if available

**Only** 
1. Use gems to open cup chests, except: 
	- to buy epic or legendary parts in the shop if it is the first or last of that part that you need
 	- to finish the public event if needed
2. Use scrap for parts needed for the team event - preferably legendary parts 

**Never** 
1. Cheat 
2. Buy chests/coins with gems in the shop
3. Scrap parts that may be needed in the future
4. Use the scrapyard if tired or impaired

## Team Philosophy
1. **We are an active and friendly team.** There are no hard rules, but participating in all team matches and 100+km a week are good signs of activity. We try to keep it clean, be respectful, and support one another. 

2. **Real life takes priority.** If you have a problem preventing you from playing, let the team know. We are extremely understanding.

3. **In-game chat** is the preferred means of communication. In the rare event of not being able to communicate in-game, feel free to use other means ( e.g. my contact detail at the bottom or the discord server https://discord.gg/HHJB2qcR )

4. **Relax and have fun!**  Rankings are secondary. (Please don't pressure anyone to perform better. If there is an issue that detracts from the positive environment, steps will be taken to address it.) 

5. **Eat plenty fiber!!** 😀
