### Leagues
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836014761102934036/836014820355473418/teams_VS.png)
- Eight divisions with an incentive to be in the top division - Top 100, 500, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000, 32000, rest
- Will have a monthly "season", with resetting at the end of the month
- Points allocated to losing teams as well, so less active teams will fall behind
> I am of the impression that the points for season rewards may be more related to each team member's scores rather than win/lose  
> E.g. if everybody scores 40k and there are 50 players, the season team points will be increased by 50x40k=+2000k
> This way they can compare teams in different divisions for purposes of promotion/relegation 
> ...  but I could be wrong!
- Points added up over month to determine level of season rewards and potential promotion/relegation
> Important to start matches ASAP to ensure we play as many matches as possible
- Will only face teams in the same division and never face the same team more than once per month
- For champions division (top 100), up to 50 teams can be relegated at the end of the month
- Champions division rewards: 1mm-1.5mm coins, 200-400 gems depending on month-end position, plus potential bonus rewards (chest?)
- Can be demoted multiple divisions.  Cannot be promoted more than two divisions
> This system means that every player's score counts as it could impact not only season rewards but also potential promotion/relegation
> i.e. No more relaxing if it is a clear win/loss
> Strong incentive to ensure every member pulls their weight. I would not be suprised if this results in more aggressive mergers, recruitment and pruning of teams.
> I'm concerned that this could put pressure on the team culture, as strong players will be less happy about carrying weaker players.  I am very open to suggestions of how we can keep things harmonious given the increased incentives for mercenary action.
> Let's keep in mind that our team is about relaxing and having fun.  And that we should not jeopardize this for a few extra rewards!
> I expect us to be in the second best division - with perhaps occasional months in the top division?

### Track Tips

 
 Track | Cup | Tip 
 :--: | :--: | :--   
**The Carousel** | Bill's Circuit 2 | Do a backflip at high point in cave e.g. with rally  
**Flying Log** | Forest Cup 3 | Wait five seconds to reposition fuel  
**Forgotten Highway** | | High roads are generally quicker if you can make them  
**Frostfire Caverns** | | Go under the second mountain i.e.down into the cavern  
**Lonely Camper** | Boggy Road 3 | Generally smoother to go the low route at 320m to go (near the start)  
**Muddy Road** | Boggy Road 1 | Often quicker to break through the board at 200m to go, and go down  
**Snappy Swamps** | Alligator Cup 2 | ⚠ alligators at 50m to go. Fly over and wheelie; or go under carefully if you fit  
**Tunnel Vision** | Tunnels 1 | Go down the tunnel at 280m to go. It is a shortcut  
**Watery Tunnel** | Cup of City Water 2 | Generally quicker to brake and go low route through the water  



### General HCR2 Advice  
1. Be respectful and friendly to others  
2. Finish the weekly public event

7. Do all the adventure tasks (at least to level 1 chest)  
8. Finish the 3 daily tasks (at least the easy ones)   
9. Have a chest timing down

12. Compete in every team event  
13. Buy 10k common and 50k rare parts in the shop with coins if available  

**Only**  
1. Use gems to open cup chests, except:  
	- to buy epic or legendary parts in the shop if it is the first or last of that part that you need

### Philosophy  
1. **We are an active and friendly team.** There are no hard rules, but participating in all team matches and 100+km a week are good signs of activity. We try to keep it clean, be respectful, and support one another.    

2. **Real life takes priority.** If you have a problem preventing you from playing, let the team know. We are extremely understanding.  

3. **In-game chat** is the preferred means of communication. In the rare event of not being able to communicate in-game, feel free to use other means ( e.g. my contact detail at the bottom or the discord server https://discord.gg/HHJB2qcR )  

4. **Relax and have fun!**  Rankings are secondary. (Please don't pressure anyone to perform better. If there is an issue that detracts from the positive environment, steps will be taken to address it.) 

5. **Eat plenty fiber!!** 😀
